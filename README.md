We are supposed to write something about ourselves......soooooooo, I decided to put in my artistic bio.

Praised by the New York Times for her “appealingly melancholic sound” and “entertaining array of distortion effects,”Alexandria Smith is a trumpeter, improviser, and electronic musician/composer pursuing her Master's degree at Mannes the New School for Music. She has premiered works by Anthony Coleman, David Tcimpidis, Peri Mauer, Simon Hanes, Elizabeth Hoffman, Faye-Ellen Silverman. She has also performed in workshops presented by artists such as Sylvie Courvoisier, Greg Cohen, Dave Douglass, Okkyung Lee, Ikue Mori, and Michaël Attias and has performed in masterclasses by Phil Smith, Tom Hooten, Craig Morris, Michael Sachs, Chris Gekker, Tom Stevens, and Mark Gould. An avid performer of new music, she has premiered works at Spectrum, Roulette, Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, Chamber Society of Lincoln Center (with Trio Almathi), Douglass Street Music Collective, IFCP festival, Jordan Hall, the Mannes College, and Shenandoah University with groups such as the Metro Chamber Orchestra, Contemporary Music Ensemble (CME), Tilt Ensemble, Mannes Orchestra, Trio Almathi,and the MACE ensemble.
